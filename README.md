# how nueral network fit data in two multiple groups which are intercept

nueral networks are simply set of linear regrision unit with diferent define axis, so in general we defined it as x and y but when we go for hyper parameter regression nothing but planes that combination of x and y terms with function like f(x,y) vs g(x,y)
therfore nnet during learning base fitting data it genarate diferent combination accordingly adjest the function with parameters such a way that fit the cauvature.
